## About Zeek

When you have serious challenges (like scalability, integration, high availability), you don’t want an agency to learn on the job. That’s why people hire us. We start where others end. 

## Work at Zeek

We're always looking for experienced, talented developers to join our engineering team. People who understand that communication and honesty is more important than knowing everything.

### We build really cool stuff

- An ERP system for a print company that manages jobs and orders throughout the entire production chain (Laravel / WordPress)

- A real estate video creation tool with an automated video rendering system (Laravel / After Effects / Adobe Media Encoder / Apple Script)

- A SEO rank tracking SaaS that keeps track of how well customer sites are doing on major search engines (Laravel / WordPress)
